This project analyzes the COVID-19 data from the Our World in Data website. The goal of this analysis is to gain insights into the spread of COVID-19 across the world and its impact on different countries.

Data Source
The data used in this analysis was obtained from the Our World in Data website. The data is updated daily and includes information on COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccinations for countries around the world.

total_cases: the total number of COVID-19 cases reported up to the given date
total_deaths: the total number of COVID-19 deaths reported up to the given date

The data was then explored using Tableau to create visualizations that show the following:
